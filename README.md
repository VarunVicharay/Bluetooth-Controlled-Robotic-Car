# Bluetooth-Controlled-Robotic-Car

In this project we are using Bluetooth wireless technology to control our robot car. The remote in this project is an Android device which has Bluetooth feature built in. The user can perform various actions like moving Forward, Backward, move Left, move Right using commands sent from the Android mobile.

I created this project using Arduino UNO, Bluetooth Module, Motor Driver and DC Motor.
